# How to run application locally

### Install the Node package and all the necessary packages for running the application. Then create an Express application. Iniitailize npm for package.json. Create a file and write some basic code for running the app. Now run this command "node filename" for running server.

### When we use typescript, we do more work. because typescript does not run in browsers. So we need to configure the typescript for running. We need to convert typescript to javascript for the app to run. After converting typescript to Javascript, run the command "node filename". See the browser://localhost:port--this url.
